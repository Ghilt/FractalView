# FractalView

Small TODO list for what is left until 1.0:

1. Fix pinch to zoom
2. Improve landscape mode by putting a thumbnail preview when clicking a config node in free space!
3. Make sure there is no race condition in the thread handling
4. Come up with name for app
5. Improve the ancestor tile drawable
6. Update readme
7. Maybe add a flourish animation to start page
9. Get starting seed for pyramid from core/ user configurable
9.b Do other shapes than triangle
10. Credit https://shapeshifter.design/ for being a nice tool in third party credit
11. fix start layout to be anchored to top to work in landscape
12. Reproduce bug which made inline edit controls disappear once after i implemented landscape mode animation
