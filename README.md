Small TODO list for what is left until 1.0:

1. Fix pinch to zoom
2. Save button animated drawable in fractal canvas fragment
3. Make sure there is no race condition in the thread handling
4. Come up with name for app
5. Improve the ancestor tile drawable
6. Update readme
7. Maybe add a flourish animation to start page
9. Get starting seed for pyramid from core/ user configurable
9.b Do other shapes than triangle
10. Credit https://shapeshifter.design/ for being a nice tool in third party credit
