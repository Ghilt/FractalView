# FractalView

Small TODO list for what is left until 1.0:

1. Fix pinch to zoom
2. Start/Pause animated drawable in fractal canvas fragment
3. Make sure there is no race condition in the thread handling
4. Come up with name for app
5. Improve the ancestor tile drawable
6. Update readme
7. Maybe add a flourish animation to start page
9. Get starting seed for pyramid from core/ user configurable
9.b Do other shapes than triangle
10. Make back button in configuration back out of inline mode instead of backing to start
11. Fix minimize crash in canvas fragment (minimize app and start the generation again)
